#### Folder structure
This repository contains a folder structure to organize the results (*on a txt file*) for each of the Unit Test Cases applied for each of the programs. This is to ensure easy access and reference to the outcomes of different executions.

Additionally, a video has been included. This video demonstrates the execution of each program and provides a detailed explanation of the logic behind their implementation.
